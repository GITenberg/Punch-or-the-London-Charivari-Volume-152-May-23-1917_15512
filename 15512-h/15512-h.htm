    <h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

    <p>Mr. <span class="sc">William Watson</span> describes his new
    book of verse, <i>The Man Who Saw</i>, as "an intermittent
    commentary on the main developments and some of the collateral
    phenomena of the War." People are already asking, "Why was a
    man like this left out of the Dardanelles Commission?"</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Weeds are a source of great trouble to the amateur gardener,
    says a contemporary, because he is not always able to recognise
    them. A good plan is to pull them out of the ground. If they
    come up again they are weeds.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>We hope that Mr. <span class="sc">Charles Cochran</span> is
    not indisposed, but we have not noticed a new revue by him this
    week.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Sulphur from Italy is being distributed by the Explosives
    Committee. This body must not be confused with the Expletives
    Committee, which gets it supply of sulphur straight from the
    Front.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The Metropolitan Water Board is appealing against waste of
    water. It is proposed to provide patriotic householders with
    attractive cards stating that the owner of the premises in
    which the card is displayed is bound in honour not to touch the
    stuff.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>According to a member of the Inventions Board, over two
    thousand solutions of the U-boat problem have already been
    received. Unfortunately this is more than the number of U-boats
    available for experiment, but it is hoped that by strictly
    limiting the allowance to one submarine per invention the
    question may be determined in a manner satisfactory to the
    greatest possible number.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Of eight applications received by the Barnes Council for the
    vacancy of Inspector of Nuisances three came from men of
    military age. It is expected that the Council will suggest that
    these gentlemen should be invited to inspect the nuisances in
    front of the British trenches.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The proprietor of thirteen steam rollers told the Egham
    Tribunal that in two years he had only been able to take one of
    them out of the yard. We cannot think that he has really tried.
    Much might have been done with kindness and a piece of cheese,
    while we have often seen quite large steam rollers being
    enticed along the road by a man with a red flag.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A Swiss correspondent is informed that "Hindenburg's legs
    are no longer strong enough to support him." The weakness
    appears to be gradually extending to his arms.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"The starched collar must go," remarks a contemporary
    ruefully. Not, we hope, before a substitute has been found for
    some of those unwashable necks.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"Lady conductors," said the Underground Railway official
    last week, "must remember that the seats and straps are put
    there for the use of the passengers." We know all about straps,
    but we have often wondered what it feels like to use one of the
    seats on the Underground.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The police have raided a coining plant in Marylebone. It is
    becoming more and more difficult to make money.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Under a recent Government order the importation of wild
    animals into Great Britain is forbidden. Allotment holders
    throughout the country hope the order will be read out to any
    wireworm or potato-moth that attempts to land at our ports.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A deputation to the <span class="sc">Food Controller</span>
    has demanded that the allowance of bread to farm labourers
    should be increased to two pounds per head per day. The amount
    is considered excessive in view of the national needs, and the
    alternative course of permitting them to eat all they can grow
    is being favourably considered.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Mr. <span class="sc">Mitchel</span>, the Mayor of New York,
    has forbidden musicians to play the National Anthems of the
    Allies in ragtime. Mr. <span class="sc">Mitchel</span> is a
    great humanitarian and simply hates the sound of anything in
    pain.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The German Society of Actors and Singers had forbidden its
    members to sing in the United States. Enthusiasts from the
    latter country are planning an early trip to Northern France
    rather than miss entertainment in the Siegfried and Wotan
    line.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Following so closely upon the report that a Wallasey woman
    had discovered a German coin in a loaf of bread we were not
    surprised by a contemporary headline, "Seymour Hicks in a new
    Rôle."</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Damage to the extent of twenty-five thousand pounds is said
    to have been caused to the crops in Australia by mice, and the
    Australian authorities contemplate the purchase of a mouse
    trap.</p>

    <h2>RANDOM FLIGHTS.</h2>

    <h4 class="sc">By Marcus Macleod.</h4>

    <p class="ctr">(<i>With renewed acknowledgments to "The
    Skittish Weekly."</i>)</p>

    <p>It was with inexpressible relief that I heard of the narrow
    escape of the Rev. Urijah Basham. Presiding at a jumble sale at
    Sidcup he described how he had been within an ace of partaking
    of rhubarb leaves at luncheon on the previous day, but, having
    read in the morning's paper of their fatal results, wisely
    decided to abstain. I need hardly remind my readers that Mr.
    Basham is, after the Rev. <span class="sc">Joseph
    Hocking</span>, perhaps our greatest preacher-novelist. The
    jumble sale was held in the beautiful concert hall of the
    Sidcup Temperance Congregational Reed Band. The Dowager-Lady
    Bowler, Sir Moses Pimblett, and the Rev. Chadley Bandman were
    amongst those who graced the function with their presence.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A correspondent has kindly sent me a copy of <i>The Little
    Diddlington Parish Magazine</i> for April. In it there is an
    interesting letter claiming that the original of <i>Mr.
    Pickwick</i> was a benevolent gentleman named Swizzle, who was
    temporarily employed as perpetual curate of Little Diddlington
    in the sixties. The evidence on which this identification is
    founded seems to me somewhat unconvincing, as <i>Pickwick</i>
    was published in the year 1836. But Nature, as it has been
    finely said, often borrows from Art, and Fact may similarly be
    inspired to emulate Fiction.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>I promised not to trouble my readers again with the Mystery
    of the Man in the Iron Mask. But I may be allowed merely to
    mention that there is an excellent study of the subject in
    <i>The Methodist Monthly</i>, by my old friend, Professor
    Corker. The article, which runs to nearly seventy pages, does
    the utmost credit to this brilliant writer, who comes to the
    conclusion that no satisfactory solution of the mystery has
    ever been propounded or ever can be. But while his examination
    of the different theories is singularly free from bias he is
    evidently impressed by the ingenious view of Dr. Amos Stoot,
    the eminent Chicago alienist, that the masked inmate of the
    Bastille immured himself voluntarily in order to investigate
    the conditions of French prison life at the time, but, owing to
    the homicidal development of his subliminal consciousness, was
    detained indefinitely by the authorities, and during his
    imprisonment wrote the <i>Letters of Junius</i>.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>I have been reading with much enjoyment, and I hope profit,
    a book entitled <i>Behind the Ivory Gate; Being the
    Reminiscences of a Dentist</i>, by Orlando Pullar, F.R.D.S. Mr.
    Pullar's opportunities for studying the psychology of his
    clients have been exceptional, and he has turned them to rich
    account in these fascinating pages. He is, moreover, as adroit
    with his pen as with the instruments of his humane and
    benevolent calling, and has a pretty wit. Thus he tells us that
    his villa at Balham is named "Tusculum," and that, in view of
    the fact that three generations of Pullars have been dentists,
    his family can be said to be of "old extraction." This pleasant
    quip I seem to have heard before; but, with all deductions,
    there are many signs here of a strong sagacious mind, that
    brings to bear on all the jars of daily life the priceless
    emollient of moral uplift.</p>

    <h2>THE MUD LARKS.</h2>

    <p>Never have I seen a kiltie platoon wading through the cold
    porridge of snow and slush of which our front used to be
    composed, but I have said, with my French friend, "<i>Mon Dieu,
    les currents d'air!</i>" and thank Fate that I belong to a race
    which reserves its national costume for fancy-dress balls.</p>

    <p>It is very well for MacAlpine of Ben Lomond, who has stalked
    his haggis and devoured it raw, who beds down on thistles for
    preference and grows his own fur; but it is very hard on Smith
    of Peckham, who through no fault of his own finds himself in a
    Highland regiment, trying to make his shirt-tails do where his
    trousers did before. But the real heather-mixture,
    double-distilled Scot is a hardy bird with different ideas from
    <i>nous autres</i> as to what is cold: also as to what is hot.
    Witness the trying experience of our Albert Edward.</p>

    <p>Our Albert Edward and a Hun rifle grenade arrived at the
    same place at the same time, intermingled and went down to the
    Base to be sifted. In the course of time came a wire from our
    Albert Edward, saying he had got the grenade out of his system
    and was at that moment at the railhead; were we going to send
    him a horse or weren't we?</p>

    <p>Emma was detailed for the job, which was a mistake, because
    Emma was not the mount for a man who had been softening for
    five months in hospital. She had only two speeds in her
    repertoire, a walk which slung you up and down her back from
    her ears to her croup, and a trot which jarred your teeth loose
    and rattled the buttons off your tunic. However, she went to
    the railhead and Albert Edward mounted her, threw the clutch
    into the first speed and hammered out the ten miles to our
    camp, arriving smothered in snow and so stiff we had to lift
    him down, so raw it was a mockery to offer him a chair, and
    therefore he had to take his tea off the mantelpiece.</p>

    <p>We advised a visit to Sandy. Sandy was the hot bath
    merchant. He lurked in a dark barn at the end of the village,
    and could be found there at anytime of any day, brooding over
    the black cauldrons in which the baths were brewed, his
    Tam-o'-shanter drooped over one eye, steam condensing on his
    blue nose. Theoretically the hot baths were free, but in
    practice a franc pressed into Sandy's forepaw was found to have
    a strong calorific effect on the water.</p>

    <p>So down the village on all fours, groaning like a Dutch brig
    in a cross-sea, went our Albert Edward. He crawled into the
    dark barn and, having <!--page 331 full page illustration-->
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page332" id="page332"></a>[pg
    332]</span> no smaller change, contributed a two-franc bill to
    the forepaw and told Sandy about his awful stiffness. His
    eloquence and the double fee broke Sandy's heart. With great
    tears in his eyes he assured Albert Edward that the utmost
    resources of his experience and establishment should be
    mobilised on his (Albert Edward's) behalf, and ushered him
    tenderly into that hidden chamber, constructed of sacking
    screens, which was reserved for officers. Albert Edward peeled
    his clothes gingerly from him, and Sandy returned to his
    cauldrons.</p>

    <p>The peeling complete, Albert Edward sat in the draughts of
    the inner chamber and waited for the bath. The outer chamber
    was filled with smoke, and the flames were leaping six feet
    above the cauldrons; but every time Albert Edward holloaed for
    his bath Sandy implored another minute's grace.</p>

    <p>Finally Albert Edward could stand the draughts no longer and
    ordered Sandy, on pain of court-martial and death, to bring the
    water, hot or not.</p>

    <p>Whereupon Sandy reluctantly brought his buckets along, and,
    grumbling that neither his experience nor establishment had had
    a fair chance, emptied them into the tub. Albert Edward stepped
    in without further remark and sat down.</p>

    <p>The rest of the story I had from my groom and countryman,
    who, along with an odd hundred other people, happened to be
    patronising the outer chamber tubs at the time. He told me that
    suddenly they heard "a yowl like a man that's afther bein' bit
    be a mad dog," and over the screen of the inner chamber came
    our Albert Edward in his birthday dress. "Took it in his
    sthride, Sor, an' coursed three laps round the bath-house
    cursin' the way he'd wither the Divil," said my groom and
    countryman; "then he ran out of the door into the snow an' lay
    down in it." He likewise told me that Albert Edward's
    performance had caused a profound sensation among the other
    bathers, and they inquired of Sandy as to the cause thereof;
    but Sandy shook his Tam-o'-shanter and couldn't tell them;
    hadn't the vaguest idea. The water he had given Albert Edward
    was hardly scalding, he said; hardly scalding, with barely one
    packet of mustard dissolved in it.</p>

    <p>Our Albert Edward is still taking his meals off the
    mantelpiece.</p>

    <p>I met my friend, the French battery commander, yesterday. He
    was cantering a showy chestnut mare over the turf, humming a
    tune aloud. He looked very fit and very much in love with the
    world. I asked him what he meant by it. He replied that he
    couldn't help it; everybody was combining to make him happy;
    his C.O. had fallen down a gun-pit and broken a leg; he had won
    two hundred francs from his pet enemy; he had discovered a
    jewel of a cook; and then there was always the Boche, the
    perfectly priceless, absolutely ridiculous, screamingly funny
    little Boche. The Boche, properly exploited, was a veritable
    fount of joy. He dreaded the end of the War, he assured me, for
    a world without Boches would be a salad sans the dressing.</p>

    <p>I inquired as to how the arch-humourist had been excelling
    himself lately.</p>

    <p>The Captain passaged his chestnut alongside my bay, chuckled
    and told me all about it. It appeared that one wet night he was
    rung up by the Infantry to say that the neighbouring Hun was up
    to some funny business, and would he stand by for a barrage,
    please?</p>

    <p>What sort of funny business was the Hun putting up?</p>

    <p>Oh, a rocket had gone up over the way and they thought it
    was a signal for some frightfulness or other.</p>

    <p>He stood by for half an hour, and then, as nothing happened,
    turned in. Ten minutes later the Infantry rang up again. More
    funny business; three rockets had gone up.</p>

    <p>He stood by for an hour with no result, then sought his bunk
    once more, cursing all men. Confound the Infantry getting the
    jumps over a rocket or two! Confound them two times! Then a
    spark of inspiration glowed within him, glowed and flamed
    brightly. If his exalted <i>poilus</i> got the wind up over a
    handful of rockets, how much more also would the deteriorating
    Boche?</p>

    <p>Gurgling happily, he brushed the rats off his chest and the
    beetles off his face, turned over and went to sleep. Next
    morning he wrote a letter to his "god-mother" in Paris ("<i>une
    petite femme, très intelligente, vous savez</i>"), and ten days
    later her parcels came tumbling in. The first night (a Monday)
    he gave a modest display, red and white rockets bursting into
    green stars every five minutes. Tuesday night more rockets,
    with a few Catherine-wheels thrown in. Wednesday night,
    Catherine-wheels and golden rain, and so on until the end of
    the week, when they finished up with a grand special attraction
    and all-star programme, squibs, Catherine-wheels, Roman
    candles, Prince of Wales' feathers, terminating in a blinding,
    fizzing barrage of coloured rockets, and "God bless our Home"
    in golden stars.</p>

    <p>"All very pretty," said I, "but what were the results?"</p>

    <p>"Precisely what I anticipated. A deserter came over
    yesterday who was through it all and didn't intend to go
    through it again. They had got the wind up properly, he said,
    hadn't had a wink of sleep for a week. His officers had
    scratched themselves bald-headed trying to guess what it was
    all about. All ranks stood to continuously, up to their waists
    in mud, frozen stiff and half drowned, while <i>my</i> brave
    little rogues of <i>poilus</i>, mark you, slept warm in their
    dug-outs, and the only man on duty was the lad who was touching
    the fireworks off. O friend of mine, there is much innocent fun
    to be got out of the Boche if you'll only give him a
    chance!"</p>

    <h3>AN AFRICAN APPEAL.</h3>

    <p>The Baboo must look to his laurels, for other dusky
    aspirants to fluent articulate culture are on the warpath, and
    they are by no means to be underrated. I have seen lately quite
    a number of letters from young studious gentlemen of Ashantee,
    who, having acquired a little English, desire more, and develop
    a passion for correspondence with English strangers, whose
    names they pick up. The following typical example, dated March
    9th, 1917, will serve to illustrate the new habit:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"<span class="sc">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am with much
        pleasure to indite you about your name that has come to my
        hand with great, joy. On the receipt of this letter, know
        that I want to be one of your fellow friends. You have been
        reported to me by a friend of mine of your good attention
        and benevolences. My openion of writing you is to say, I
        want to take you as my favourite friend. Everything or news
        that may be happened there at your side, I wish you to
        report same to me. And I also shall report same to you
        satisfaction. Will you be good enough to agree with me?
        Then I hope to get few lines of news from you being as you
        consented or disconsented. To have a friend at abroad is
        something that delights the life. I am earnestly requested
        to hear from you soon. I beg to detain, dear Sir,</p>

        <p class="quotsig">&quot;Yrs truly,<br />
         &mdash;&mdash;."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>To whom do you think that letter is addressed? You would
    suppose to some public personage with a reputation for cordial
    sympathy with the young and earnest, such as the
    <span class="sc">Chief Scout</span>, for instance. But no, the
    "Dear Sir" is in reality a limited liability company, one of
    whose circulars, I suppose, wandered to the Gold Coast.</p>

    <h2>THE LAW COURTS THEATRE.</h2>

    <h4>"ROMNEY'S RUM 'UN."</h4>

    <p>London was probably never richer in comic actors than at the
    present moment, for not only is W.H.
    <span class="sc">Berry</span> at the Adelphi,
    <span class="sc">Leslie Henson</span> at the Gaiety,
    <span class="sc">Arthur Roberts</span> at the Oxford singing
    his old songs, and <span class="sc">Robert Hale</span> and
    <span class="sc">George Robey</span> twice daily elsewhere, but
    in the Law Courts Playhouse <span class="sc">Charles
    Darling</span> has been lately at his very best. Dropping in
    there last week, during the performance of a new farce,
    entitled <i>Romney's Rum 'Un</i>, I was again fascinated by the
    inexhaustible wit and allusive badinage of this great little
    comedian, beside whose ready gagging <span class="sc">George
    Graves</span> himself is inarticulate. Had not
    <span class="sc">George Robey</span> invented for application
    to himself the descriptive phrase, "The Prime Minister of
    Mirth," it should be at once affixed to the Law Courts'
    fun-maker; but, since it is too late to use that, let us think
    of him as "The Chancellor of the Exchequer of Mirth."</p>

    <p><span class="sc">Charles Darling's</span> success is the
    more remarkable because he keeps so still. He sits in his chair
    as steadily as another of his outdistanced rivals,
    <span class="sc">Sam Mayo</span> ("The Immobile Comedian," as
    he is called), remains standing. He has few gestures; he
    rarely, if ever, sings, and I have never seen him dance; and
    yet the way in which he "gets over" is astonishing. "Laughter
    holding both his sides" is the most constant attendant of this
    theatre.</p>

    <p>What is the secret? Well, first and foremost it is of course
    to be sought in the genius of the actor himself; but
    contributory causes are the acceptivity of the audience, which
    is more noticeable in the Law Courts than in any other London
    theatre, and the willingness of his fellow-performers to "feed"
    him, as stage-folk have it; that is to say, provide him with
    materials upon which (again resorting to stage language) he may
    "crack his wheezes." The other day, for example, that excellent
    comedian, <span class="sc">John Simon</span>, was his principal
    ally in this way, and nothing could have been better than the
    sympathy between the two funny men. To <span class="sc">Charles
    Darling</span> naturally fell the fat of the dialogue, but no
    one enjoyed the treat more than <span class="sc">John
    Simon</span>, in whose dictionary the word jealousy does not
    exist. <span class="sc">Leslie Scott</span> also did his best
    to "feed" his principal, and the results were a scream.</p>

    <p>If the jokes were now and then a little legal, what did it
    matter? Many of the audience were legal too, and that there is
    no better audience the reports of the farces played here day
    after day abundantly prove. They are out for fun, and therefore
    in an appreciative and complaisant mood.</p>

    <p>To prove a comedian's genius to the mere reader is a
    difficult matter, and one can never hope to re-embody him in
    all his humorous idiosyncracies; but quotation comes to one's
    aid, and in the case of such a wit as <span class="sc">Charles
    Darling</span> it is invaluable. Thus <span class="sc">John
    Simon</span>, referring to Mrs.
    <span class="sc">Siddons</span>' unwieldiness in her old age,
    said that in a certain part she had to be helped from her knees
    by two attendants. Quick as lightning came the comment, "When
    she was younger she was able to rise on her own merits." Was
    ever so exquisitely funny and unexpected a turn given to the
    dull word "merits"? Another perfect thing from this diverting
    piece, followed also by Homeric cachinnations, was the
    mock-serious apophthegm: "If a cloud is going to support a lady
    of substantial proportions, you must make it fairly solid."</p>

    <p>I came away with reluctance, filled with wonder at the want
    of enterprise shown by our revue-managers in not having, long
    ere now, secured <span class="sc">Charles Darling's</span>
    services. If only he continues to take his art seriously he has
    a great future. Meanwhile I am applying embrocation to my sore
    sides.</p>

        <p>Our racing correspondent writes that Mr.
        <span class="sc">Lloyd George</span> is having some
        difficulty with his string (Sinn Fein's Beauty
        <span class="sc">Ginnell</span>, All and More for Ireland
        <span class="sc">Redmond</span>, and Ulster
        <span class="sc">Carson</span>) for the Irish Grand
        National.</p>
    </div>

    <p><i>Monday, May 14th</i>.&mdash;No longer will the
    <span class="sc">First Sea Lord</span> be distracted from his
    primary duty of strafing the Hun by the necessity of looking
    after supplies. That function will now be discharged by an hon.
    and temp. Vice-Admiral, in the person of Sir
    <span class="sc">Eric Geddes</span>, late hon. and temp.
    Major-General and Director of Transportation to the Army in
    France, and now Shipbuilder-in-Chief to the nation. Everyone
    seemed pleased, with the notable exception of Mr.
    <span class="sc">Hogge</span>, who cannot understand why all
    these appointments should be showered upon Sir
    <span class="sc">Eric Geddes</span>, when there are other able
    Scotsmen still unemployed. A late hon. Admiral of the Fleet,
    now residing at Potsdam, is believed to share Mr.
    <span class="sc">Hogge's</span> objections.</p>

    <p>The hardships endured by the criminal classes when they are
    so unfortunate as to get into prison always strikes a
    sympathetic chord in the gentle breast of Mr.
    <span class="sc">Edmund Harvey</span>. His latest discovery is
    that they are allowed the use of writing-paper not more than
    once a month; and for the rest of the time have to entrust
    their literary compositions to the unsympathetic surface of a
    slate, with the aid of a probably squeaky slate-pencil. Could
    <span class="sc">John Bunyan</span> have written <i>The
    Pilgrim's Progress</i> under such conditions? The question
    opens up a vista of speculation as to the influence of
    environment upon the creative faculty; and it is not surprising
    that Mr. <span class="sc">Brace</span> was unable to answer it
    offhand.</p>

    <p>In ordinary times the Financial Secretary of the Treasury is
    the most important Member of the Government outside the
    Cabinet. Under the present <i>régime</i> he is not a member of
    the House at all. It is true that Mr.
    <span class="sc">Baldwin</span> takes his place as
    Parliamentary whipping-boy to the <span class="sc">Chancellor
    of the Exchequer</span> with much grace and good humour; but
    that does not satisfy hon. Members, who want a more substantial
    object for their daily castigation. The debate on this subject
    revealed a sharp division of opinion between Mr.
    <span class="sc">Edwin Montagu</span> and Mr.
    <span class="sc">Herbert Samuel</span>. <span class="sc">Cousin
    Edwin</span>, as an ex-Secretary of the Treasury, did not think
    the House had suffered any serious loss through being unable to
    cross-examine that official direct. <span class="sc">Cousin
    Herbert</span> was shocked at this revolutionary sentiment
    coming from his kinsman. If it were accepted there was no
    logical reason why even the Chancellor of the Exchequer should
    have a seat in the House. Why, indeed, have Ministers at all? A
    row of gramophones, ranged along the Treasury Bench and
    supplied with officially prepared records, would satisfy all
    legitimate curiosity.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, May 15th</i>.&mdash;I forget how many weeks ago
    it is since Mr. <span class="sc">Bonar Law</span> announced
    that the Government were going to make one more effort to
    settle the Irish Question, and that in due course the
    <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span> would announce their
    proposals. Since then events have conspired to produce
    successive postponements. Mr. <span class="sc">Lloyd
    George</span> had to go to France&mdash;for the War refuses to
    stop even though Irishmen decline to encourage it&mdash;Mr.
    <span class="sc">Redmond</span> fell ill, Archbishop
    <span class="sc">Walsh</span> indited a postscript, and an
    election in South Longford suggested doubts as to whether
    Nationalist M.P.'s were really the Irish nation after all.
    Nevertheless there is a plan; and it is to be communicated, but
    in the first instance to the leaders of Irish parties only, and
    then, if they please, to the Press, and finally, perhaps, to
    the House of Commons.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, May 16th</i>.&mdash;We all want to help the
    new Russian Government in its difficult task, but I doubt if
    Mr. <span class="sc">Snowden</span> and his pacifist friends
    have contributed to that end by inviting the House of Commons
    to endorse forthwith the "no annexation, no indemnities"
    declaration of a section of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page339" id="page339"></a>[pg
    339]</span> Revolutionaries, and by supporting their proposal
    in a series of speeches which might be summed up in the words
    "Peace at any Price." Even the German
    <span class="sc">Chancellor</span> will not be wholly pleased,
    for the debate revealed that, apart from the seven or eight
    gentlemen who follow the white flag of the Member for
    Blackburn, the House is absolutely fixed in its determination
    to defeat German militarism before talking of peace.</p>

    <p>After the searching analysis to which the hon. Member's
    confident statements were subjected by Lord
    <span class="sc">Robert Cecil</span> and Mr. A.F.
    <span class="sc">Whyte</span> there was nothing left of them
    but a trace of acid.</p>

    <p>So far as I am aware the Member for Blackburn has never
    endangered the integrity of his principles by helping his
    country in any way to win the War. In this respect Mr.
    <span class="sc">Lees Smith</span>, who seconded the motion,
    has a less consistent record, for he has worn khaki as an
    orderly of the R.A.M.C. But in his case service abroad seems
    only to have confirmed his peculiar principles, for he thinks
    that we ought to return the German colonies, and enable the
    natives to enjoy once again the blessings of <i>Kultur</i>. If
    he ever saw the Hun while he was in France it must have been
    through a pair of rose-tinted binoculars.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, May 17th</i>.&mdash;We are all agog to know
    whether the <span class="sc">Prime Minister's</span> offer of
    immediate Home Rule to twenty-six Counties of Ireland is to be
    blessed or banned by the Nationalists. This is the day when
    Irish Questions have priority, and the House hears such
    important inquiries as whether Hibernian holiday-makers will
    have their excursion-trains restored to them; what became of a
    side of bacon captured by the police during the Easter Monday
    rebellion, and why a certain magistrate should have been struck
    off the Commission of the Peace for a trifling refusal to take
    the oath of allegiance. Are we to go without this entertainment
    in the future, or will Mr. <span class="sc">Redmond</span>
    refuse to rob Westminster of its gaiety even for the sake of
    College Green?</p>

    <p>If, as I ventured to suggest last week, the
    <span class="sc">Chancellor of the Exchequer</span> had laid in
    a stock of tobacco before the Budget he has evidently exhausted
    it by now, for, on his attention again being called to the
    exorbitant charge of the tobacconists, he no longer pooh-poohed
    the matter, but sternly declared that the situation was being
    closely watched.</p>

    <h2>THE DOLLS THAT DID THEIR BIT.</h2>

    <p><i>"Je vous tends mon corbillon: qu'y met-on?"</i> asked
    Jeanne, holding out her basket towards the first of her dolls
    seated in a semi-circle before her. Most of them were quite
    familiar with the game, but for the sake of a new-comer Jeanne
    had explained that each player must place in the basket some
    object the name of which ended with <i>on</i>, to rhyme with
    <i>corbillon</i>. She had announced that this time the game was
    in aid of a cause, and that therefore it must be played with
    <i>things</i> and not with words only.</p>

    <p>"Qu'y met-on, Marie?" repeated Jeanne. "Rappelez-vous bien
    que c'est une quête à l'intention des petites filles polonaises
    internées au camp de Havelberg!" What, Marie had nothing but
    her chain necklace, and that did not end in <i>on?</i> No, but
    the links of the chain did, argued Jeanne. "Donne <i>des
    chaînons!</i>" she prompted in a whisper. "J'y mets des
    chaînons," said Marie in Jeanne's thinnest voice, and the
    necklace found its way into the basket.</p>

    <p>"<i>Je vous tends mon corbillon: qu'y met-on?</i> À vous,
    Marthe. Ô," exclaimed Jeanne, "tu y mets ton <i>chignon?</i> Eh
    bien, tu sais, n'est-ce pas, bêta, qu'il faut que tu t'y mettes
    avec!" and into the basket she went after a lingering caress
    from Jeanne.</p>

    <p><i>"Je vous tends mon corbillon: qu'y met-on?"</i> It was
    the turn now of Yvonne in her bed. "Comment," said Jeanne,
    affecting indignation, "si tu n'étais pas si frileuse tu
    donnerais ton édredon?" And what about the little <i>poupées
    polonaises internées</i>, snatched from their beds and carried
    off without any bedclothes at all, let alone an eiderdown!
    Presently, "J'y mets mon édredon," Yvonne was understood to
    say, and "Sage!" approved Jeanne.</p>

    <p><i>"Je vous tends mon corbillon: qu'y met-on?</i> Jacques,
    mon pauvre ami, tu n'as pas de chance, hein?" There was no help
    for it; it was the only thing he had that rhymed. "Imagine la
    joie des petites polonaises internées!" she urged, taking the
    necessary action. "J'y mets mon pantalon," piped a disconsolate
    little thread of voice.</p>

    <p><i>"Je vous tends mon corbillon: qu'y met-on?</i> A vous,
    Mikadesse!" A beam of pleasure, succeeded by a falling of the
    countenance, then a look of decision, ended in a "Houp-là!" as
    the Japanese doll descended into the basket, and was made to
    say, "J'y mets une poupée du Japon!" After all she was an ally
    of the little polonaises.</p>

    <p><i>"Je vous tends mon corbillon: qu'y met-on?</i> Allons,
    les jumeaux! à vous!" Jeanne thought the twins were really in a
    plight and that she would have to help them out with a gift,
    but, quick as thought, Castor seized Pollux, saying, "J'y mets
    mon compagnon!" and Pollux, divining his intention, grasped
    Castor, declaring excitedly, "Et moi aussi, j'y mets mon
    compagnon" And into the basket they leapt together. "Ils
    s'entêtent à rester inséparables," sighed Jeanne; "c'est
    bien."</p>

    <p><i>"Je vous tends mon corbillon: qu'y met-on?"</i> Adélaïde
    never had possessed anything worth giving away, and yet she
    seemed to be suggesting that the contents of the basket did not
    look very imposing so far, and would hardly be enough to go
    round among so many little Poles, so Jeanne came to the rescue
    with gifts of toys until "J'y mets ma contribution!" came
    jubilantly forth in a voice that forgot to be Adélaïde's.</p>

    <p>All had now contributed. Yet Jeanne had a feeling that
    somehow it was not the end of the game. She pondered gravely
    for a few moments, then, placing herself solemnly before the
    mirror, she addressed herself:&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>"Jeanne, je vous tends mon corbillon: qu'y met-on?"</i>
    After a few seconds she began to see what she ought to do.</p>

    <p>"Qu'y mets-tu, Jeanne?" It would be rather hard, but she
    must do it.</p>

    <p>Sitting down and turning up the skirt of her frock, she took
    each of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page341"
    id="page341"></a>[pg 341]</span> contributors, kissed and
    caressed them, and placed them in her lap. Adélaïde only did
    she except, explaining to the others, "Oui, mes chéris, je
    garde Adélaïde, car savez-vous bien, c'est elle qui me donne
    des idées; je prends toujours conseil avec elle. Alors, n'est
    ce pas?" Then, carrying the dolls in her petticoat, she
    solemnly undid the button, let it slip down with the dolls
    inside, and placed it resolutely in the basket, saying: "J'y
    mets mon jupon!"</p>

    <p>What was Adélaïde saying? One must give cheerfully and not
    regret the gift? <i>Surtout il ne faut pas verser une
    larme!</i></p>

    <p>So, hugging her doll, Jeanne returned to the mirror and
    added, smiling, "Avec sa-tis-fac-ti-on!"</p>

    <h2>PEAS AND PLEDGES.</h2>

    <p>"Has anything special," I said, "been happening during my
    absence?"</p>

    <p>"We are up to our chins in work," said Francesca.</p>

    <p>"But is it real work?"</p>

    <p>"Of course it is. We've formed a General Committee, of which
    everybody's a member, including you, and we've formed an
    Executive Committee, of which there are about a dozen members.
    And then there are some Sub-Committees."</p>

    <p>"Yes, I know. The Executive Committee thinks it's going to
    do all the work, but it's got to report to the General
    Committee, and it it'll be a great piece of luck if the General
    Committee doesn't insist on asserting itself by upsetting all
    the decisions of the Executive Committee."</p>

    <p>"Oh, but our General Committee isn't going to be like that
    at all. There won't be any petty jealousy about our General
    Committee. Besides, the Executive Committee has power to act,
    and it doesn't need to report till the Annual Meeting of the
    General Committee, which is to be held a year from now. When
    that time comes lots of things will have happened."</p>

    <p>"That," I said, "is one of the truest things you've ever
    said. Even the War may be over by that time."</p>

    <p>"But if it isn't we shall all be living on swedes or
    pea-soup, or rice-bread or all three together; and we shall
    have a food controller in every village, and our Committees
    won't be wanted."</p>

    <p>"I beg your pardon; they'll be more wanted than ever to keep
    the controller straight and act as a buffer between him and the
    population."</p>

    <p>"But they won't know they're a buffer, and they won't like
    it when some tactless person tells them. Anyhow, that's a long
    way off, and in the meantime we've got the land."</p>

    <p>"Who've got what land?"</p>

    <p>"Our Committee," said Francesca, "have got two acres of land
    from Mr. Carberry, and we're going to grow a crop of peas on it
    so that everybody may have pea-soup in case of a pinch."</p>

    <p>"But what about the peas?" I said, "Have you made sure of
    those?"</p>

    <p>"We had a good deal of trouble about them, but we've got a
    firm promise of six bushels."</p>

    <p>"Capital! But are you quite sure you know how to bring the
    land and the peas together?"</p>

    <p>"Well, I'm not so much of an expert as I should like to be,
    but Mr. Bolton 's a practical farmer, and he's going to do all
    he can for us."</p>

    <p>"Will he plough it?"</p>

    <p>"It's been ploughed twice, so he's undertaken to harrow it
    and scarify it&mdash;doesn't it sound awful?&mdash;and then
    something else is going to happen to it, but I forget what it's
    called."</p>

    <p>"Wouldn't it be a good thing, at some stage or other, to
    plant the peas?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, it would; but you can't do it as simply as all that,
    can you? Isn't there something highly agricultural that you
    must do first?"</p>

    <p>"I should chuck 'em in and chance it."</p>

    <p>"A nice farmer you'd make," she said scornfully. "I'm
    remembering it now. It's got something to do with drills."</p>

    <p>"Like the Volunteers?"</p>

    <p>"No, not a bit like the Volunteers."</p>

    <p>"Well, then, like potatoes."</p>

    <p>"Yes, more like potatoes, except that they're peas in this
    case."</p>

    <p>"How true," I said.</p>

    <p>"Yes. And don't forget that while you were away we formed a
    League of Honour in the village and bound ourselves to observe
    the <span class="sc">Food Controller's</span> rations."</p>

    <p>"Am I a member?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, we thought you'd like to be one, so I gave your name
    in."</p>

    <p>"I think a man must pledge his own honour. He can't have it
    done for him."</p>

    <p>"There's no public ceremony. You can just pledge yourself in
    your mind, and then put a pledge card in one of the
    windows."</p>

    <p>"I'll have tea first," I said, "and then I'll choose the
    window, and then I'll pledge myself in my mind."</p>

    <p>"No, you can do the pledging now."</p>

    <p>"I've done it, while you were talking."</p>

    <p>"And after all it's only the old rations according to Lord
    <span class="sc">Devonport</span>, and we've been working under
    them for some time now."</p>

    <p>"So we have," I said; "but of course the card in the window
    makes all the difference."</p>

    <p>In the list of heroic young soldier-authors whose gifts the
    War has revealed to us only to snatch them away, the name of
    <span class="sc">Donald Hankey</span> already holds an honoured
    place. It will, therefore, be good news to the many admirers of
    <i>A Student in Arms</i> that a further selection of these
    heartening and fine-spirited papers has been prepared under the
    title of <i>A Student in Arms&mdash;Second Series</i>
    (<span class="sc">Melrose</span>). The thousands who already
    know and admire Lieut. <span class="sc">Hankey's</span> work
    will need no introduction to this, which exhibits all the
    qualities of courage and sympathy that have given the former
    book a world-wide popularity. They, and others, will however
    welcome the occasion afforded here of learning something about
    the life and personality of the writer, which they will do both
    from the short preface contributed by one whose identity is
    hardly disguised under the initials "H.M.A.H.," and from a
    couple of papers, autobiographical, that end the volume.
    Rugbieans especially will be interested to read
    <span class="sc">Donald Hankey's</span> recollections of his
    school-days, with their tribute to the house-master
    affectionately known to so many generations as "Jackey." A
    book, in short, that will add to the admiration and regret with
    which its author is spoken of in three continents.</p>

    <p><i>He Looked in My Window</i> (<span class="sc">Chatto And
    Windus</span>), by <span class="sc">Robert Halifax</span>,
    gives the adventures of <i>Ruth Shadd</i>, decentest of
    dwellers in a meanish street, during her determined hunt for a
    husband. It would have been easy to make all this unlovely in
    its frankness, but the author very skilfully (and, I think,
    very sincerely) avoids this. <i>Ruth</i> is a fine girl, with
    character and candour, those too rare assets, and having
    pursued, and found wanting, <i>Bert</i>, the swanker, who
    hasn't the courage for matrimony; the polite and fatuously
    prudent <i>Archie</i>, and <i>Joe</i>, the vegetarian, who had
    such exalted faith in malt, she wins a deserved happiness with
    someone that she had never even thought of pursuing. Mr.
    <span class="sc">Halifax</span> gives me an impression of
    almost cinematographic and gramophonic exactness in his
    portraiture. <i>George Shadd</i>, <i>Ruth's</i> father, who
    worked in the gasworks and was one of the very best, delighted
    me particularly, with his pathetic little garden, his battle
    with the slugs and black-fly, and his fine patience with
    <i>Mrs. Shadd</i>, who put her washing before his fire and her
    props among his choicest seedlings&mdash;a difficult woman
    indeed. The author writes with humour and sympathy; and that is
    the way to write of this brave if narrow life. It is the first
    time I have looked in Mr. <span class="sc">Halifax's</span>
    window. I shall take steps to do so again. 'Tis a nice clean
    window.</p>

    <p>Not even the most confirmed Gallio can avoid caring for
    <i>Arthur Stanton&mdash;A Memoir</i>, by the Rt. Hon. G.W.E.
    <span class="sc">Russell (Longmans)</span>, when he has once
    dipped his mind into the book. It is the record of a singularly
    beautiful and beneficent life, lived to the very utmost in the
    service of God and man, and ruled by a simple and direct
    religion which constantly forced practice up to the exalted
    level of precept. Judged by merely worldly standards of
    achievement, <span class="sc">Arthur Stanton's</span> life
    could not be considered a success. He began as curate of St.
    Alban's, Holborn, and as curate of St. Alban's he ended after
    many years of enthusiastic devotion to humanity. He was foiled
    and thwarted by the great ones of the Church, inhibited in one
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page344" id="page344"></a>[pg
    344]</span> place, suspended in another, and frequently doomed
    to find a Bishop or a Chaplain-General set, like a lion, across
    his path. But nothing could avail to stop him where he found a
    soul that could be saved or misery that could be relieved. His
    congregation, drawn from the slums of Holborn, would have died
    for him to a man, for they realised with how great an ardour
    his life was spent in order that he might help them. His faith
    was not a mystery kept apart for special occasions, but a daily
    and hourly influence vivifying his words and directing his
    actions. And no man could have enjoyed himself more than this
    true saint and interpreter of God to man. His religion was not
    one of gloom and foreboding, but a cheerful and delightful
    habit of mind and soul. <i>Tantum religio potuit suadere
    bonorum.</i> Mr. <span class="sc">Russell</span> has done his
    work with great skill and perfect sympathy, and has produced a
    book that does honour to himself and to the beloved friend whom
    it is his privilege to commemorate.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The many readers of <i>Punch</i> who took a close interest
    in <span class="sc">Alec Johnston's</span> letters written "At
    the Back of the Front" and "At the Front" will be glad to have
    them in collected form. The memory of his gallant end&mdash;he
    was killed in action after the brilliant capture of a salient
    near Ypres, at the head of his company of Shropshires&mdash;is
    fresh in all our hearts. A preface to <i>At the Front</i>
    (<span class="sc">Constable</span>) contains an appreciation of
    his high character and soldierly qualities by his friend and
    fellow-officer, Captain <span class="sc">Ingram</span>,
    R.A.M.C., D.S.O., M.C., who a few weeks later was himself
    killed. It is a fine tribute paid by one true soldier to
    another. These letters of <span class="sc">Alec
    Johnston</span>, as their editor reminds us, "were composed in
    the brief interludes snatched from hard fighting and hard
    fatigues. They never pretended to be more than the gay and
    cynical banter of one who brought to the perils of life at the
    Front an incurable habit of humour. They are typical of that
    brave spirit, essentially English, that makes light of the
    worst that fate can send."</p>

    <p>It must, I should think, be exceedingly difficult to find a
    new title in these days for a volume of reminiscences. Mr.
    <span class="sc">Raymond Blathwayt</span> seems to have solved
    the problem happily enough by calling his contribution to the
    rapidly-increasing library of recollections, <i>Through Life
    and Round the World</i> (<span class="sc">Allen</span>). One
    way and another, first as a curate (rightly termed by the
    publishers "rather unconventional"), later as journalist, Mr.
    <span class="sc">Blathwayt</span> has contrived to use a pair
    of remarkably open eyes with excellent effect. The result is
    this fat volume, whose contents, if honesty constrains me to
    call the most of them gossip, are at least generally
    entertaining and never ill-natured. Needless to say, Mr.
    <span class="sc">Blathwayt</span>, like the elder
    <i>Capulet</i>, can "tell a tale such as will please." For
    myself, out of a goodly store, I should select for first
    honours a repartee, new to me, of Sir <span class="sc">Herbert
    Tree</span> (forgive this dropping into rhyme!). It tells of a
    boastful old-time actor, vaunting his triumphs as
    <i>Hamlet</i>, when "the audience took fifteen minutes leaving
    the theatre." "<i>Was ha lame?</i>" If our only
    <span class="sc">Herbert</span> did not in fact make this
    reply, I can only hope that he will at once hasten home and do
    so. But while we are upon Mr.
    <span class="sc">Blathwayt's</span> dramatic recollections, I
    must respectfully traverse his dictum that some of the acting
    at the local pageants of a few years back "surpassed the very
    best I have seen upon the stage." As one who took a personal
    part in many of those well-meant revivals, and dates a relaxed
    throat from the effort of vociferating history, up-wind,
    towards a stand full of ear-straining auditors, I bow but
    remain unconvinced.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Although the literary style of Mr. <span class="sc">Julius
    M. Price</span>, of <i>The Illustrated London News</i>, is too
    breezy for my taste, I am glad to have read his <i>Six Months
    on the Italian Front</i> (<span class="sc">Chapman and
    Hall</span>). Possibly he under-estimates our appreciation of
    Italy's share in the War's burden, but his account of the
    conditions prevailing upon the Italian front, and of the
    courage and skill with which they have been overcome, deserves
    our undiluted approval. It is difficult to believe that anyone
    who is not at least a member of the Alpine Club can dimly
    realise the engineering feats which the Italian soldiers have
    performed. Mr. <span class="sc">Price</span> has been given
    many opportunities of observation, and where none was given to
    him he has contrived to make them for himself. And the result
    is a book full of incident and excitement. I hope that he will
    pardon me when I add that my sense of gratitude would have been
    greater if, in addition to the photograph of himself&mdash;or
    even instead of it&mdash;he had given us a map. For the rest
    his illustrations are excellent.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>To <span class="sc">Martin Swayne</span>, officer in the
    R.A.M.C., on his lawful occasions or in the intervals of
    swatting flies <i>In Mesopotamia</i> (<span class="sc">Hodder
    and Stoughton</span>), there came some thoughts pleasant and
    bitter, and you can see that he has selected the pleasant and
    cut out the others, partly because of his loyalty and humour,
    and partly, no doubt, in deference to the prejudices of
    censorship. And he writes his selection of printable remarks in
    a very agreeable and not undistinguished idiom, pointing the
    narrative with reflections sane and sage enough. He has also
    made some water-colour notes (here reproduced in colour) of
    things seen; not remarkable, but adequate to convey an
    impression. We have all lamented the confusions (shall we call
    them?) of the medical service, and the trials of our troops in
    that blessed region entered through Kurna, the Gate of the
    Garden of Eden, in the early days of the Mesopotamian
    adventure. The author reports a radical improvement, and if
    Eden isn't exactly the name you'd give to this pest-ridden
    country at least the fighting men are now backed by the
    devotion and competence of the healing men, and all goes well
    for both. To the bulldog might well be added the retriever as
    our national emblem. We are some retrievers.</p>

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
